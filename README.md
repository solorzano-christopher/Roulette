# Roulette
Made a Roulette Game for class. Very fun project.
# How to play
Playing Roulette is a very simple game. A roulette wheel has 38 bins. Thirty-six bins are numbered from 1 to 36. 
The last two bins contain 0 and 00. The two zero bins are colored green. The others are colored randomly red and black,
18 of each color. As the wheel spins, a ball is dropped into the wheel. When the wheel stops spinning, the ball comes to rest in one bin.
# Assignment
You are to write a program that models a roulette wheel. The ball can fall randomly into one of 38 diï¬€erent bins. 
You are to calculate all the winning bets according to the bin the ball falls into. Use arrays to model this game. 
 You should use two arrays to model the wheel (numbers and colors). You can use arrays as appropriate to determine the winning bets.
